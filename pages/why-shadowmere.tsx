				Awarded to the player character after completing the purification of
				the Cheydinhal Sanctuary by Black Hand mentor Lucien Lachance,
				Shadowmere, in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, is an indestructible
				heroic character who represents the fastest and most powerful horse
				in the game. Hallmarked by purple-highlighted black skin and burning
				red eyes, Shadowmere is an iconic character that has captured the
				imaginations of players, and developers, even 300 game-years later
				in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. In Skyrim, Shadowmere is again
				awarded to the player character for success, this time by Astrid.
				When the player is granted the ability to summon the late Lucien
				Lachance as a Spectral Assassin and does so in Shadowmere&apos;s
				presence, Lachance&apos;s spectre will greet her as an &apos;old friend&apos;. In
				ES V, however, Shadowmere is no longer absolutely indestructible.
				<br />
				<br />
				While surely vastly harder to kill than typical bought horses in the
				game, it can be killed in steep falls and by concentrated frost or
				fire attacks by Ancient-ranked dragons, especially when it cannot
				manoeuvre out of close quarters when being attacked by said Ancient
				dragon. Shadowmere can also be killed by Mehrunes&apos; Razor. In
				Oblivion, Shadowmere could be knocked unconscious by intensive
				attacks. Then, players could store or retrieve objects from it just
				like a container. In Skyrim, once Shadowmere is finally killed,
				arrows that have been fired into the horse over the time it has been
				with the Dragonborn can be recovered. Shadowmere apparently
				reincarnates between eras, potentially changing subspecies of horse,
				and genders.
